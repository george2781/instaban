# THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY UNTESTED, EXPECT ISSUES LMAO
# Instaban
I was disappointed with the insta ban server, so I decided to make something that can make a REAL instaban
## Demo server
https://discord.gg/KRVDgsfq6A
## Installation
### Install dependancies
Install python and then run
`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
If that doesn't work then remove the 3 from python3
### Get a bot to use it with
If you don't know how to make a bot and get it's token, google is your friend.
### Add the token to the file
Change the line with client.run("token here") to have your bot's token between the ""
### Add the bot to the server you want to instaban on
Google is your friend for that one too.
### Run the bot
Run the following
`python3 bot.py`
If that doesn't work then remove the 3 from python3, you get the point
### Enjoy
I specifically requested it.
